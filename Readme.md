# Crypthon

My tiny implementation of classic asymmetric ciphers.

## Features :
* Primality tests : Fermat / Miller-Rabin
* Basic random prime generator / primitive root finder
* RSA encryption/decryption
* Really basic ElGamal encryption/decryption

### To do :
* Implement AKS primality test
* Solve message size problem in RSA
* Improve power computation in ElGamal

### Note :
This implementation does not intend to be secure nor seek performance.
