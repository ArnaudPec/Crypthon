# Crypthon

My tiny implementation of classic asymmetric ciphers.

## Features :
* Primality tests : Fermat / Miller-Rabin
* Basic random prime generator
* RSA encryption/decryption

### To do :
* Implement AKS primality test
* Implement ElGamal encryption/decryption
* Solve message size problem in RSA

### Note :
Does not intend to be secure nor seek performance
